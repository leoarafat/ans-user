        Client Content; Services
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        (a) Client Content. “Client Content” consists of all sound recordings
        and video recordings (both short-form and long-form), and related
        metadata owned or controlled by Client (or by Client’s affiliates or
        companies acquired by Client, or with whom Client has merged, or from
        whom Client has obtained rights), whether created prior to the Effective
        Date of the Agreement or at any time during the Term (as defined below).{" "}
        <br />
        (b) Appointment as Sole Distributor. Client agrees that this Agreement
        is exclusive during the Term and throughout the Territory for the
        distribution of Client Content by ANS Music via any and all digital and
        electronic distribution means and media (whether now known or existing
        in the future). Client grants ANS Music the exclusive right to create
        digital and/or electronic copies and compilations, to distribute, to
        sell copies, to stream and to publicly perform, to sublicense and to
        otherwise exploit Client Content via electronic, digital and mobile
        platforms during the Term. Client shall not, during the Term, license or
        attempt to license Client Content to DSPs without prior written approval
        from ANS Music. All pre-existing relationships with outside DSPs related
        to Client Content, if any, are to be disclosed to ANS Music at the time
        of entering into this Agreement. During the Term, Client shall not
        itself make Client Content available via any electronic, digital or
        mobile platform or channel. If Client distributes their content via
        another distributor during the Term, ANS Music has the right to issue a
        notice to the Client or the other distributor regarding the breach of
        this exclusivity agreement. <br /> (c) DSPs. ANS Music agrees to
        distribute and license Client Content to DSPs that sell, distribute,
        transmit, stream, perform or otherwise exploit sound and/or audiovisual
        recordings by all means and media available, and to collect all income
        deriving therefrom. ANS Music shall: (i) solicit and service the DSPs;
        (ii) secure the encoding of each Recording in format(s) required by the
        DSPs; (iii) process the delivery of the recordings to the DSPs; and (iv)
        collect amounts due from the DSPs for payment to Client, subject to the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
        the Client Royalty (as defined below) account Threshold (as defined
        below) requirements outlined in this Agreement. <br /> (d) Marketing.
        Promptly following the full execution of this Agreement, Client shall
        supply ANS Music with a reasonable number of ID Materials. As used in
        this Agreement, the term “ID Materials” means any of Client’s, or any of
        Client’s artists’ or writers’, respective copyrights, trademarks, names,
        sobriquets, biographical materials and approved likenesses, as well as
        the names, sobriquets and approved likenesses of any other person
        performing on and/or performing services in connection with Client
        Content. All ID Materials furnished by Client to ANS Music, posted on
        Client’s website or social media channels, or previously approved by
        Client at any time will be deemed approved by Client for use by ANS
        Music in connection with Client Content hereunder, and ANS Music will
        also have the right to create and use additional, basic marketing
        materials embodying the ID Materials to promote Client Content. For the
        avoidance of doubt, ANS Music shall have the right, but not the
        obligation, to use the ID Materials to promote Client’s and/or Client’s
        artists’ or writers’ brand(s) on ANS Music’s website and/or social media
        channels. Client agrees to use reasonable efforts to independently
        promote the Client Content during the Term, including, without
        limitation by sharing promotional assets produced by ANS Music hereunder
        on Client’s social media channels. <br /> (e) Branding. The artwork and
        promotional materials provided by ANS Music Limited shall prominently
        feature the ANS Music logo.

        Additional Services. The following additional services are included
        under this Agreement:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        (a) DSP Playlist Pitching & Features. ANS Music will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to promote individual recordings delivered hereunder
        for inclusion on official and unofficial playlists on DSPs, as deemed
        appropriate for the particular recording by ANS Music. ANS Music does
        not guarantee and shall not be responsible for the placement of any
        recording(s) on any playlist(s). ANS Music will not be required to and
        shall not notify Client if a recording is added or removed from a
        playlist. <br /> (b) YouTube Content ID. ANS Music will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to (i) identify exploitations by unauthorized third
        parties of Client Content via the YouTube platform; and (ii) negotiate
        and document settlement, licensing, monetization and similar agreements
        with such third parties on behalf of Client in respect of such
        exploitations, the terms of which such agreements shall be determined by
        ANS Music in its sole reasonable discretion. Any Client Content will
        only qualify for such YouTube Content ID services if such Client Content
        is one hundred percent (100%) owned and controlled by Client and does
        not include any third-party materials or public domain contributions.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
        Client will be entitled to receive [70%] of the Royalties actually
        collected by ANS Music as a result of YouTube Content ID services or
        credited to ANS Music against a previously received advance in respect
        of Client Content. <br /> (c) YouTube Compositions. ANS Music will
        assist Client with the implementation of industry standard best
        practices for the collection of YouTube revenues in connection with the
        underlying musical compositions embodied in Client Content.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
        Client will be entitled to receive [70%] of the Royalties actually
        collected by ANS Music as a result of YouTube Compositions services with
        respect to such compositions. <br /> (d) VEVO: ANS members are included
        in Vevo, featuring the official Vevo watermark on YouTube. Vevo enables
        viewing on platforms like Roku, Samsung & LG Smart TVs, and Comcast. ANS
        Music collects royalties for music videos, with the client receiving
        70%. <br /> (e) Catalog Transfer from Other Distributors. In the event
        that there are more than 100 previously released recordings being
        transferred from Client’s prior distributor to ANS Music for
        distribution hereunder, ANS Music will use commercially reasonable
        efforts to facilitate such transfer on Client’s behalf (collectively,
        “Catalog Transfer Services”); and if there are 100 or fewer previously
        released recordings being transferred from Client’s prior distributor to
        ANS Music for distribution hereunder, ANS Music will provide Client with
        information on how to facilitate such transfer via ANS Music’s systems;
        provided, in all cases, that Client shall give ANS Music satisfactory
        evidence (in ANS Music’s sole discretion) of Client’s rights in and to
        the recordings being transferred and the release thereof by such prior
        distributor.

        Delivery; Storage:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        <strong>Delivery Procedures :</strong> {""}
        (a) Delivery Procedures. (i) ANS Music Backstage. Client shall deliver
        Client Content to ANS Music via its online Dashboard System (“ANS Music
        Backstage”). Client Content shall be delivered promptly following the
        execution of this Agreement and from time to time during the Term at
        Client’s own expense. Client Content shall be technically and
        commercially satisfactory to ANS Music and shall be delivered in
        first-class commercial quality, in compliance with the specifications
        stated on ANS Music Backstage and all marketing and related materials
        shall bear an appropriate copyright notice. Where applicable, Client
        shall provide administrative logins and access for digital or streaming
        channels. Delivery will not be deemed complete until ANS Music provides
        written confirmation thereof. Denial of Client Content may occur for
        various reasons and as outlined in Section 13 of this Agreement. (ii)
        Delivery to/from ANS Music. Except as may otherwise be expressly
        provided herein where ANS Music is providing Catalog Transfer Services,
        Client is solely responsible for uploading Client Content to ANS Music
        Backstage for distribution. ANS Music does not obtain or secure transfer
        of Client Content from Client’s former distributor or other third
        parties. Upon the expiration or termination of the Term, ANS Music will
        no longer host Client Content on its servers and ANS Music will not be
        responsible for transferring Client Content from ANS Music to Client or
        any third party. (iii) Client Responsibility. Client will be solely
        responsible for ensuring that Client Content and account details are
        correct and updated in ANS Music Backstage at all times. <br /> (b)
        Storage. Client acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for
        storage and backup of Client Content on Client’s own server(s) or
        devices. ANS Music may store specific files for distribution purposes
        but is not obligated or required to store Client Content. ANS Music is
        not obligated to provide Client with copies of Client Content in the
        event Client requests same. <br /> (c) Updates (Redelivery, Mistakes,
        File Replacements). Client must use commercially reasonable efforts to
        ensure that its material is correct and final prior to delivering same
        to ANS Music’s distribution department for approval and delivery to
        DSPs. Requests for changes are to be submitted via ANS Music Backstage.
        During the Term, Client may not contact any DSP directly in respect of
        Client Content. ANS Music cannot guarantee that any DSP will acknowledge
        or agree to any requested change(s). Client agrees to provide ANS Music
        with replacement files, if requested, for purposes of re-delivery. For
        the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 4(c) and Section
        4(b) above do not, and shall not be deemed to, impose or impart any
        storage, backup or retrieval obligations on ANS Music with regard to
        Client Content. <br /> (d) Takedowns. If ANS Music takes down any Client
        Content (each, a “Takedown”) pursuant to Section 10(f) of this
        Agreement, without limiting any of ANS Music’s available rights or
        remedies, ANS Music will charge a USD $15 processing fee per release
        subject to any Takedown. <br /> (e) DSP Specifications. Each DSP has a
        different standard or requirement for Client Content. ANS Music agrees
        to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Client to meet each
        DSP’s requirements.

        Fees, Royalties and Accounting.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        (a) Client Royalty Details (all fees in US dollars). As used in this
        Agreement, the term “Royalties” means the revenues actually received by
        ANS Music from DSPs and other third parties or credited to ANS Music
        against an advance previously received by ANS Music in respect of the
        Client Content, less any fees imposed by DSPs or other third parties.
        Subject to the recoupment of all Advances and all of ANS Music’s rights
        to withhold Royalties otherwise due to Client pursuant to this
        Agreement, Client will be entitled to receive [70%] of the Royalties.
        Client must meet a Royalties-due threshold of fifty dollars ($50.00 USD)
        as of Client’s last Royalty Statement posting (the “Threshold”) for
        Client to be eligible to request payment within the ANS Music Backstage.
        The Threshold amount is subject to change at any time and Client shall
        be notified in the ANS Music Backstage of any such change.
        <br />
        (b) Royalties. All Royalty-related rates, including Threshold
        requirements, are available online. Payments are made in US dollars.
        Failure to reach the Threshold will result in non-payment, and the
        unpaid Royalty amount will accumulate each month until the Threshold is
        met and at which time, Client can request payment within ANS Music
        Backstage, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this
        Agreement.
        <br />
        (i) Calculation. Subject to recoupment of all Advances paid hereunder,
        Royalties are calculated by the DSP platform upon which the Client
        Content appears and are processed in accordance with the currency
        exchange rates provided by DSPs to ANS Music or the exchange rate listed
        on the day the DSP reports to ANS Music. Royalties may vary based on
        type of content, territory, subscription rates, or time of year. In most
        instances, Royalties are generated by content downloads and streaming.
        If a DSP does not appear on Client’s Royalty statement (“Statement”),
        the Client Content did not generate any Royalties from that DSP during
        that Statement period or the DSP has not yet paid Royalties to ANS Music
        for that period. Client may view posted Statements on ANS Music
        Backstage.
        <br />
        (ii) Mechanical Royalties received directly from DSPs. Client grants to
        ANS Music an irrevocable license under copyright to reproduce each
        composition embodied in the Client Content for uses as contemplated
        hereunder. Client hereby acknowledges that in the United States,
        mechanical royalties for digital sales of copies of Client Content may
        be paid by DSPs: (A) directly to the music publishers/writers; or (B) as
        part of an all-in payment to ANS Music, which includes any fees due to
        ANS Music (e.g., currently Beatport and Traxsource). When ANS Music
        receives mechanical royalties as part of the fee due from DSPs or
        others, ANS Music shall identify in the relevant Statement(s) the amount
        of the payments that comprises mechanical royalties. The Royalty will
        then be payable to Client pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.
        Without limiting Client’s representations, warranties and indemnities
        under this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, Client acknowledges
        and agrees that as between Client and ANS Music, Client remains solely
        responsible for paying any and all mechanical royalties due to third
        parties in connection with the exploitation of Client Content by ANS
        Music pursuant hereto.
        <br />
        (iii) Monthly Accounting/ Payments. ANS Music shall compute and report
        the total Royalties earned by Client on a monthly basis. A schedule of
        when the Royalty Statements are posted and approximate payment dates for
        the postings are located in the Help Desk and ANS Music Backstage.
        Royalty Statement reports are available electronically to Client via ANS
        Music Backstage approximately 60-70 days after a reporting month ends
        (each, a “Monthly Submission Date”). For example, January reporting will
        occur at or around the end of March, February reporting at or around the
        end of April, and so on.
        <br />
        (A) Statements. Each Statement will include details and total Royalty
        amounts payable to Client, if any. Statements posted may include both
        the immediate previous month amount and additional previous months’
        amounts. ANS Music cannot guarantee timely reporting and payment by all
        DSPs and thus, ANS Music Statements will include payments only for DSP
        payments ANS Music has received or which have been credited to ANS Music
        against an advance previously received by ANS Music in respect of the
        Client Content. Solely by way of example, some DSPs report to ANS Music
        on a quarterly basis. Client acknowledges and agrees that ANS Music will
        have no liability for DSPs’ late or otherwise untimely reporting or
        payment.
        <br />
        (B) Payment. Subject to the Threshold and all other terms and conditions
        in this Agreement, (i) in order to receive payment, Client must issue a
        payment request via ANS Music Backstage when Royalty Statements are
        available; and (ii) ANS Music shall issue payment via the payment method
        designated by Client in ANS Music Backstage within ten (10) business
        days of receipt of each such payment request. Client is required to
        identify the payment method within ANS Music Backstage (Local Bank
        Transfer(BD), ACH, wire, Payoneer, etc.) and in some instances,
        additional fees may apply for certain payment methods. Failure by Client
        to provide complete and accurate payment details and/or to submit a
        payment request through ANS Music Backstage may prevent and/or delay ANS
        Music from paying any Royalty to Client. Without limiting the foregoing,
        Client represents and warrants that: (i) any and all payment information
        submitted to Client’s ANS Music Backstage account shall be complete and
        accurate at all times; (ii) ANS Music shall have the right to rely upon
        such information and shall have no liability whatsoever by reason of any
        erroneous payment made in accordance with such information; and (iii)
        Client shall indemnify ANS Music against claims, liabilities, losses and
        expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) relating to or arising
        out of any payments made by ANS Music pursuant to such information.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
        Client acknowledges and agrees that Client may be required to submit
        identity verification related documentation (e.g., driver’s license,
        passport, etc.) to ANS Music in accordance with ANS Music’s then current
        policies and procedures as specified in the ANS Music Backstage in order
        to receive Royalties payable to Client hereunder (if any). Client
        information collected in accordance therewith will be governed by ANS
        Music’s Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        (C) Statement Delay by ANS Music. Client shall promptly advise ANS Music
        if Client has not received a Statement. Upon notification, ANS Music
        shall investigate and/or correct the situation, as appropriate. Subject
        to Section 6(b)(iii)(B) above, in no event shall ANS Music be deemed in
        breach of its payment obligations under this Agreement by virtue of the
        fact that Client has not received payment or a Statement by the
        applicable Monthly Submission Date.
        <br />
        (D) Statement Delay by DSPs. In the event that a statement is not
        provided to ANS Music by a DSP within a reasonable amount of time, ANS
        Music will not be deemed in breach of this Agreement for failing to
        provide a statement with respect to such DSP. ANS Music will use
        reasonable efforts to report any DSP that has yet to provide a statement
        on a monthly basis which will be accessible when available via ANS Music
        Backstage.
        <br />
        (E) Tax Details. ANS Music conforms to United States IRS-issued
        guidelines. Client must confirm Client’s tax residency status by
        submitting Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and
        Certification (for U.S. citizen and residents), or Form W-8BEN,
        Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax
        Withholding and Reporting (individuals) (for non-U.S. residents)
        digitally, via ANS Music Backstage in order to receive any payments due
        hereunder. Tax details can be viewed or edited by Client in ANS Music
        Backstage. Tax details must be filled out fully and correctly prior to
        Client claiming and receiving payment. ANS Music will request additional
        information from Client regarding tax details as needed. Client and ANS
        Music each have the status of an independent contractor hereunder, and
        nothing in this Agreement contemplates or constitutes one party as agent
        or employee of the other or a partnership relationship between Client
        and ANS Music. ANS Music will not deduct any payroll-related taxes from
        any payments to be made to Client under this Agreement. Client
        acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for the payment of all
        taxes with respect to income received by Client pursuant to this
        Agreement.
        <br />
        (F) Additional DSP Fees. DSPs may impose additional fees that are
        outside of ANS Music’s control. Such DSP fees may be deducted by ANS
        Music from revenues generated hereunder for the purposes of calculating
        Royalties (e.g. for voided transactions, promotional expenses, and
        publishing withholding, without limitation). (c) Notwithstanding
        anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any and all
        amounts paid by ANS Music (other than Royalties) to Client, on Client’s
        behalf or at Client’s direction will constitute Advances and be fully
        recoupable from all Royalties payable to Client hereunder. For purposes
        of this Agreement, the term “Advance” means a prepayment of Royalties
        payable to Client. ANS Music may recoup Advances from any and all
        Royalties to be paid or accrued to Client pursuant to this Agreement.
        <br />
        (d) Other than as specifically provided in this Agreement, ANS Music

        Contractor appoints Distributor to manage synchronization/sampling
        opportunities. Such opportunities are subject to Contractor's prior
        approval (email being sufficient). However, where governed by a
        collective agreement or a user generated content license, Contractor's
        approval is not required. Accordingly, ANS Music Limited is granted the
        right to authorize third parties to (i) use the Content (in whole or in
        part) within an audio visual work (movie, advertisement, documentary,
        multimedia program, etc.) or live show ("Synchronization Right") and
        (ii) to authorise third parties to use samples taken from Recordings to
        produce new recordings, either audio or audiovisual (so-called
        'sampling'). Those rights are granted by Contractor to Distributor, on a
        non-exclusive basis during the Exclusive Distribution Period.

        months from each Monthly Submission Date to have a certified public
        accountant, who is licensed in the US and not then engaged in an
        outstanding examination of ANS Music’s books and records on behalf of a
        third party, conduct an inspection of ANS Music’s books and records
        specifically relating to the DSP’s licenses to exploit Client Content

        will have access only to those records of DSPs and retailers relating to
        Client Content hereunder (i.e. not including the reporting information
        of any other client). Each such inspection shall take place at the

        shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any error, omission, or
        other inaccuracy of any such statement(s) or information received by ANS
        Music, provided ANS Music does not know or has no reliable business
        reason to know of an error, omission, or other inaccuracy in such third

        Client shall be solely responsible for payment to its affiliated

        the creation of any Client Content distributed under this Agreement
        including, without limitation, payment of any mechanical royalties in
        connection with the Client Content. Client shall also be responsible for
        payments related to any applicable collective bargaining agreements,
        third-party licenses, music publishing licenses and other royalties
        pertaining to such Client Content. For the avoidance of doubt, in
        connection with the exploitation of Client Content under this Agreement,
        Client shall be solely responsible for any obligations or liabilities to
        such third parties related to such exploitation. Notwithstanding
        anything to the contrary contained herein, if, solely as an
        accommodation to Client, Client desires that ANS Music pay a portion of
        any Royalties otherwise payable to Client to one or more third parties
        to whom Client is obligated to pay a portion of such Royalties (each, a
        “Third Party Payee”), directly to such Third Party Payees on Client’s
        behalf (“Third Party Royalties”), Client may enable ANS Music’s

        Authorization and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
        foregoing shall not be deemed to limit Client’s obligation to pay any

        Client warrants and represents that it owns and/or controls all rights

        limited to sound recordings, audiovisual works, compositions, ID
        Materials, artist names, writer names, song names, artwork and images)
        which are necessary for ANS Music to exercise the rights granted to ANS
        Music in this Agreement. Client also guarantees that it has secured
        written permission from any and all third parties whose performances
        and/or contributions are embodied in Client Content or underlying
        compositions embodied therein. Client will not deliver any Client
        Content and/or ID Materials to ANS Music which is not owned and/or
        controlled by Client. Client further grants ANS Music a license to use
        the ID Materials during the Term and throughout the Territory in

        without limitation the distribution and promotion of Client Content,

        otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
        to the contrary contained herein: (a) ID Materials provided by Client to
        ANS Music shall be deemed approved by Client for use by ANS Music
        pursuant hereto; (b) in any instance where Client’s approval is required
        hereunder, Client’s approval shall be deemed given if notice of Client’s
        disapproval is not received by ANS Music within five (5) business days
        of ANS Music’s request for approval, unless a shorter time period is
        specified in any such request; and (c) ANS Music’s inadvertent failure
        to obtain Client’s approval of any ID Materials shall not be deemed a
        breach of this Agreement nor shall such failure derogate from ANS
        Music’s right to use such ID Materials hereunder. No use of any ID
        Materials by ANS Music hereunder will constitute an endorsement or
        implied endorsement by Client or any person of any activity, cause,

        Materials themselves).

        Termination and Breach.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        (a) Client Content Remaining. Upon expiration or termination of the
        Term, ANS Music will use commercially reasonable efforts to actively
        seek Takedowns for Client Content previously distributed under this
        Agreement. However, Client acknowledges that (i) ANS Music will not be
        responsible for any failure to effectuate or any delay in effectuating
        any Takedown on the part of a DSP; and (ii) ANS Music will not be
        subject to any liability for previously distributed Client Content which
        remains with DSPs or third parties after the expiration or termination
        of the Term, with the understanding that subject to the terms and
        conditions set forth in this Agreement, ANS Music will continue to pay
        to Client any Royalties received for any such Client Content or credited
        to ANS Music against an advance previously received by ANS Music in
        respect of any such Client Content in accordance with Section 6(a)
        above.
        <br />
        (b) Payments. Upon expiration or termination of the Term, all Royalties
        received by ANS Music for Client Content will continue to be handled in
        accordance with the payment provisions set forth in Section 6 above,
        subject to the following. Upon completion of the month following
        expiration or termination of the Term, ANS Music will issue a final
        Statement to Client with all Royalties earned/accumulated for which ANS
        Music has received such information from DSPs. Any payments due to
        Client at such time will not be expedited following expiration or
        termination of the Term. In the event that additional Royalties
        accumulate in Client’s account following the final Statement, ANS Music
        will provide additional Statement(s) to Client only if ANS Music
        receives a request from Client for additional Statement(s) via the ANS
        Music Backstage help desk. No act or omission by ANS Music shall
        constitute a breach of this Agreement unless Client first notifies ANS
        Music in writing setting forth such alleged breach and ANS Music does
        not cure the same, if capable of being cured, within thirty (30) days
        after the date of ANS Music’s receipt of such notice.
        <br />
        (c) ANS Music Rights to Terminate. Notwithstanding any other termination
        provisions contained herein, ANS Music reserves the right to terminate
        the Term of this Agreement anytime for any reason immediately upon
        written notice to Client.
        <br />
        (d) Injunctive Relief. Without limiting any of ANS Music’s available
        rights or remedies, in the event that Client breaches or threatens to
        breach Client’s exclusivity obligations hereunder, then ANS Music shall
        be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief, without the
        posting of a bond, in order to prevent or cure such breach.
        <br />
        (e) Attorneys’ Fees. In the event of a dispute concerning the terms of
        this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from
        the other party reasonable outside attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by
        the prevailing Party in such dispute.
        <br />
        (f) Copyrights/ Content Disputes. In the event that ANS Music receives a
        notice of any Claim (as defined below) pertaining to any Client Content
        or ID Materials or any other Claim alleging that any Client Content or
        ID Materials violate the rights of any third party, then without
        limiting ANS Music’s available rights or remedies, (i) ANS Music will be
        entitled to withhold Royalties otherwise payable to Client while such
        Claim is pending (it being understood that ANS Music cannot control the
        length of any Claim); (ii) ANS Music will use commercially reasonable
        efforts to notify Client of such Claim; and (iii) ANS Music may issue
        and/or authorize Takedowns for any affected Client Content, in its sole
        discretion. In addition to the above, ANS Music may request
        documentation to support the ownership or control by Client of Client
        Content and/or ID Materials from Client at any time and for any reason.
        Without limiting any of ANS Music’s other rights and remedies, Client’s
        failure to provide documentation within three (3) business days of ANS
        Music’s request for same may result in non-payment of Royalties,
        Takedown of Client Content, and/or immediate closure of Client’s
        account, all at ANS Music’s sole election.

        affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
        licensees, successors, assigns, representatives, and agents
        (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all
        anticipated, threatened or actual demands, actions, suits, losses,
        liabilities, obligations, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
        outside attorney’s fees and/or other costs and fees and any damages or
        settlement payments incurred by the Indemnified Parties) which result
        from or arise in connection with or are related in any way to: (i) a
        breach or threatened breach by Client of any of Client’s
        representations, warranties, covenants and/or obligations under this
        Agreement; (ii) any attempt by any person or entity to cause or require
        any Indemnified Party to pay or discharge any debt, obligation,
        liability or commitment of Client; or (iii) any act or omission of
        Client (each of (i)-(iii), a “Claim”), including, without limitation,
        any Claim that any Client Content may infringe upon the copyright,
        trademark and/or other intellectual property right of any third party
        and/or violate the rights of privacy and/or publicity of any third
        party. Client shall have the right at its own expense to participate in
        the defense of a Claim with counsel of its own choosing, provided
        however that the Indemnified Parties’ decision in connection with the
        defense or settlement of any such Claim or demand shall be final.
        Without limiting ANS Music’s other available rights or remedies, Client
        shall reimburse ANS Music on demand for any payment made at any time by
        ANS Music in respect of any Claim, or ANS Music may instead deduct the
        amount of any such payment from any Royalties otherwise payable to
        Client pursuant to this Agreement, all at ANS Music’s sole discretion.
        Any failure of the Indemnified Parties to notify Client of any Claim
        shall not relieve Client of its indemnification obligations hereunder.
        Client’s representations, warranties and indemnification obligations
        under this Agreement, as well as all of ANS Music’s claims against
        Client for any breach thereof, shall survive the expiration or
        termination of the Term and continue in perpetuity thereafter.
        <br />
        (b) Without limiting any of ANS Music’s available rights or remedies
        under this Agreement, at law or in equity, in the event of any Claim,
        ANS Music will have the right to avail itself of any or all of the
        following remedies, in its sole discretion: (i) ANS Music may suspend
        payment of Royalties otherwise payable to Client (if any) while such
        Claim is anticipated or pending (notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary contained herein, this remedy shall not apply in the case of a
        Claim arising out of or relating to Improper Activity, with respect to
        which Royalties shall be solely governed by Section 6(d) above); (ii)
        ANS Music may issue and/or authorize Takedowns for any affected Client
        Content; (iii) ANS Music may terminate the Term of this Agreement and
        require Client to repay one hundred percent (100%) of Client’s
        then-outstanding unrecouped balance, if any; (iv) ANS Music may block or
        prevent Client from uploading additional Client Content to ANS MusicMS;
        and/or (v) ANS Music may enforce its indemnification rights pursuant to
        this Agreement. Any release of Royalty payments hereunder shall be
        without prejudice to ANS Music’s rights to not make Royalty payments in
        the future with respect to such Claim or any other Claim if ANS Music
        deems it reasonably necessary in ANS Music’s sole discretion. Client
        shall notify ANS Music in writing immediately if Client receives notice
        of any Claim related to Client Content. The Indemnified Parties’ right
        to indemnification hereunder will not be affected by any information or
        knowledge acquired by the Indemnified Parties at any time.

        (a) Election Not to Distribute. ANS Music and/or a DSP may elect not to
        distribute any Client Content for any of the following reasons: (i) if,
        in the opinion of ANS Music and/or the DSP, such distribution might
        violate a statute, law or regulation, or violate any rights of any
        persons or entities, including suspected violation of the intellectual
        property of another; (ii) ANS Music and/or a DSP believes that its
        distribution of any of Client’s recordings hereunder would constitute a
        breach by Client of any of Client’s agreements, warranties and/or
        representations contained herein or if ANS Music and/or a DSP reasonably
        deems the recording or the associated artwork or other associated ID
        Materials to be offensive to reasonable standards of public morals; or
        (iii) the submitted recording does not comply with the current
        specification stated on ANS MusicMS. Notwithstanding the preceding
        sentence, in the event the objectionable material is later eliminated,
        or the source of objection is removed, Client may resubmit the
        applicable Client Content to ANS Music for review and possible
        distribution hereunder at ANS Music’s and/or the applicable DSP’s sole
        discretion.
        <br />
        (b) Scandalous Material. ANS Music will not distribute scandalous,
        illegal, hateful, objectionable or offensive material. ANS Music and
        DSPs reserve the right to reject or retract distribution of any Client
        Content containing any such material at their discretion.
        <br />
        (c) Parental Advisory. The parties shall cooperate in implementing any
        applicable parental advisory labeling. It is understood that Client
        shall use reasonable efforts to click “Explicit” while submitting any
        Client Content if the material contains explicit material. Client
        acknowledges that explicit material is different than, and may not rise
        to the level of, scandalous material.
